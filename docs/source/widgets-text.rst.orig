Widgets: Displaying Text
************************

Textfield, TitleText
   A single line of text, although of arbitrary length - the basic entry widget.

FixedText, TitleFixedText
   A single line of text, but with the editing functions of Textbox removed.

PasswordEntry, TitlePassword
   A textbox but altered so that the exact letters of *.value* are not displayed.  

Autocomplete
   This is a textbox but with additional functionality - the idea is that if the user presses TAB the widget will attempt to 'complete' what the user was typing, offering a choice of options if appropriate.   The method called is `auto_complete(inputch)`.

   Of course, context is everything here.  *Autocomplete* is therefore not useful, but is intended as something you can subclass.  See the Filename and TitleFilename classes for examples. 

Filename, TitleFilename
   A textbox that will attempt to 'complete' a filename or path entered by the user.
   
   This is an example of the *Autocomplete* widget.

FilenameCombo, TitleFilenameCombo
	This is a more advanced way to select files.  New in version 2.0pre82.


MultiLineEdit
   This widget allows the user to edit several lines of text. 

Pager, TitlePager
   This widget displays lines of text, allowing the user to scroll through them, but not edit them.  The text to display is held in the `.values` attribute.


In detail

.. py:class:: Textbox

    .. py:method:: display_value(vl)
        
        Control how the value of the `.value` attribute is displayed.  Since versions of the text widgets are used in other, compound widgets (such as most of the multiline classes), this method is often overridden. 
        
    .. py:method:: show_brief_message 
    
        Beep and display a brief message to the user.  In general, there are better ways to do this, but this is somtimes useful, for example when showing errors in Autocomplete classes.
